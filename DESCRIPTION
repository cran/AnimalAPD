Description: Calculation and analyses of Activity Probability Density (APD) for comparing animal activity patterns 
    with automated Bayesian model selection using 'STAN'. See Campbell et al. (in press) "A new approach to comparing 
    animal temporal activity: a more informative, robust, and flexible method that controls for nested data, quantifies 
    relationship asymmetries, and allows linear modelling of temporal behaviour."
